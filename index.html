            <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl">Through the use of advanced nanotechnology formulas, your vehicle will be layered with a
                protective coating that can last for months on end. Harsh elements, bird droppings, bugs, and much more
                will wipe right off or not stick at all. Once applied you can instantly notice the ultra-slick
                protective layer.</p>

            <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl">Due to a deep mirror like finish, your vehicle will attract a lot of attention. It will
                give off a deep shine that is visible from a distance. Even if you have an older vehicle with dated
                paint, this will still turn back the clock for results that youâ€™ve never experienced before.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl my-4 font-bold">Fast detailing</h2>
            <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl">Simply spray and wipe away for a spotless finish that lasts for weeks. With its
                hydrophobic properties, Fortify Quick Coat protects your car's paint from water spots, stains, and
                contaminants. And the best part? It's safe for all surfaces, including glass, plastic, and chrome.</p>
